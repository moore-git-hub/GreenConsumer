# Introduction
This example demonstrates how to build a simple Multi-Agent System using Agent-Kernel, designed to help users understand the execution flow and facilitate future extensions.

To simplify the process, we have provided basic implementations for five core plugins: Perceive, Plan, Invoke, Communication, and Space. The remaining plugins are structured as placeholders (using pass) to allow for easy customization and expansion by the user.

# Quick Start
1. Set your api key in **`examples/standalone_test/configs/models_config.yaml`**

    ```yaml
    - name: OpenAIProvider
      model: your-model-name
      api_key: your-api-key
      base_url: your-base-url
      capabilities: ["your-capabilities"] # e.g., capabilities: ["chat"]
    ```
    
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install "agentkernel-standalone[all]"
    ```
    
3. Run
    ```bash
    cd Agent-Kernel
    python -m examples.standalone_test.run_simulation
    ```
